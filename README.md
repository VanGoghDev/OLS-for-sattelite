# PCA-for-sattelite
My course project at institute. I should to create a PCA algorhitm in order to estimate an orbit of satellite

based on apriory analysis

__Model__

A sattelite which moves around the Earth orbit at _normal Gravity Field_ 

Initial data are specified in the osculating elements

1. Orbital Inclination is 42 degrees

2. Semimajor axis we can count from specified axes of ellips
